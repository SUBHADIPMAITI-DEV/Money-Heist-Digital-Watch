I've created three files for your GitHub repository:

1. **README.md** - A comprehensive readme file that includes:
   - Project overview and features
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage guide
   - Project structure
   - Technologies used
   - Customization options
   - Contributing guidelines

2. **requirements.txt** - A reference file listing the main dependencies:
   - Note that Next.js projects typically use package.json instead
   - Includes all the major dependencies with version requirements
   - Contains instructions for installing dependencies with npm/yarn

3. **INSTALLATION.md** - A detailed installation guide:
   - Step-by-step instructions for beginners
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Deployment instructions
   - Additional resources

These files provide comprehensive documentation for your Money Heist Digital Watch project, making it easy for users to install, use, and contribute to your repository.
